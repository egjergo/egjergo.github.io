    <p align="justify">I was born in Tirana (Albania) to artist parents. My father is considered the best modern-style painter of the Communist era. Here is a <a href="https://youtu.be/IC5n3oJ7Qfk" target="_blank">2021 Albanian documentary</a> in his memory. After mourning my father who passed away when I was 15 days old, my mother fled the country in 1991 alone but with me as a toddler.</p>

<p align="justify">We then migrated to Italy where I had the fortune to experience and assimilate into the rich cultural heritage of the land. Astronomy came into my life in kindergarten, and ever since I never changed career aspiration. In middle school I had the other big fortune of getting to know the Italian Astrophysicist and former Observatory Director <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margherita_Hack" target="_blank">Margherita Hack</a> with whom I published a bestseller at the age of 16, as soon as I was authorized to sign a working contract.</p>

I obtained my high school diploma in the selective (3.5% acceptance rate) <a href="https://www.uwcad.it/" target="_blank">United World College of the Adriatic</a>, and subsequently received scholarships that helped me attend the <a href="https://www.iit.edu/" target="_blank">Illinois Institute of Technology</a> in Chicago, IL, where I was a double major in Applied Mathematics and Physics. In 2011 I joined the Supernova Cosmology group in the HEP Division of <a href="https://www.anl.gov/hep" target="_blank">Argonne National Laboratory</a>, and I continued the collaboration until the start of my graduate studies at the <a href="https://df.units.it/en" target="_blank">University of Trieste</a>, where I earned a Ph.D. in Physics in Spring 2019. In Fall 2019 I joined the newly-established Astronomy group at <a href="http://202.114.78.174/astro/index.php" target="_blank">Wuhan University</a>, where I'm presently stationed.
