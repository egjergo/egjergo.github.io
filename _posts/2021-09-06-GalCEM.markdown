### GalCEM

The code presentation has been published [by ApJS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ApJS..264...44G/abstract).

We developed GalCEM -- a highly flexible and efficient galactic chemical evolution (GCE) code, suited in particular for nuclear physicists who wish to test modeling assumptions of stellar nucleosynthesis yields on a variety of galactic morphologies. The computation adapts to accomodate all the isotopes included in the input yields, and comes with preset but customizable morphologies for the Milky Way and a selection of dwarf galaxies. 

At present, the code accepts contributions by massive stars (core collapse SNe), low-to-intermediate mass stars (AGBs), SNIa, neutron star mergers, collapsars, and magneto-hydrodynamic supernova jets. Upon first release the code will be one-zone, but will soon be expanded to more complex environments. GalCEM's modular structure can be easily expanded to accomodate other galactic formation models and we welcome external collaborators and independent users alike.
