### GalCEM

Work in preparation.

We have developed a highly flexible and efficient galactic chemical evolution (GCE) code, suited in particular for nuclear physicists who wish to test modeling assumptions of stellar nucleosynthesis yields on a variety of galactic morphologies. The computation adapts to accomodate all the isotopes included in the input yields, and comes with preset but customizable morphologies for the Milky Way and a selection of dwarf galaxies. 

At present, the code accepts contributions by massive stars (core collapse SNe), low-to-intermediate mass stars (AGBs), SNIa, neutron star mergers, collapsars, and magneto-hydrodynamic supernova jets. Upon first release the code will be one-zone, but will soon be expanded to more complex environments.
