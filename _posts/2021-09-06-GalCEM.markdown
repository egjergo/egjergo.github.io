### GalCEM

Work in preparation.

We have developed a highly flexible and efficient galactic chemical evolution (GCE) code, suited in particular for nuclear physicists who wish to test modeling assumptions of stellar nucleosynthesis yields on a variety of galactic morphologies. At present, the code accepts contributions by massive stars (core collapse SNe), low-to-intermediate mass stars (AGBs), SNIa, neutron star mergers, collapsars, and magneto-hydrodynamic supernova jets.
